# Game description

This game is a two dimension variant of the Rubik cube. The board of the game consists of n x n
fields. There are n different colors, and exactly n fields have the same color. The fields are shuffled
initially. A player can move cyclically the colors of a row or column (e.g. moving a row to the right,
the color of the first field will be the color the last field) to make homogenous rows and columns. The
game ends, when each row (or column) contains one color.
Implement this game, and let the board size be selectable (2x2, 4x4, 6x6). The game should recognize
if it is ended, and it has to show in a message box how much steps did it take to solve the game. After
this, a new game should be started automatically.
